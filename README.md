Project Description

This project focuses on manual testing of a Car Listing Mobile Application to ensure functionality, usability, and performance quality. The application includes features such as Recently Listed cars, Near Cars, dealer interaction, and user profile management. Comprehensive manual testing was performed to identify defects related to car details display, image loading, share/like/call functionalities, feedback options, logout process, and overall application performance.

All identified issues were documented using standard bug reporting practices, including screen name, bug title, detailed description, steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, and severity classification. This project demonstrates practical experience in functional testing, UI/UX testing, negative testing, and bug documentation, following real-time industry standards.
